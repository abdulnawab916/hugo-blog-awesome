## About This Project

This website is a personal portfolio that showcases my final project for my Upper Division Writing class at UC Davis.  
Titled **"Love, your Son,"** it is a documentary video-essay made in memory of my late father, **Abdul Hai Nawab**.

The project explores identity, masculinity, grief, and love, all framed through a deeply personal lens. It is a letter to my father, but also a reflection on what it means to grow into manhood in the wake of loss. It also serves as a gift for my family and to commemorate my Father's memory for graduation.

## Who I Am (Bio)

My name is **Abdul Hanan Nawab**. I am currently a student at UC Davis, studying **Computer Science and Engineering** and on track to graduate this upcoming week (June 15th, Father's Day).

Outside of academics, Iâ€™m a filmmaker, and writer. I created this project as a way to blend art, memory, and storytelling, not just to fulfill an assignment, but to make peace with parts of my past.

This project has been both cathartic and creatively challenging. It draws from personal narratives, cultural traditions, and documentary-style video-editing to craft something meaningful.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is structured around different stages of the project

**Process**: My initial ideas, planning, and development (including flowcharts and peer feedback)

**Drafts**: Revised versions of two major writing assignments that supported the project

**Showcase**: The final documentary video, rubric, and evaluation

**Reflection**: My final thoughts, lessons learned, and how this shaped my approach to writing
