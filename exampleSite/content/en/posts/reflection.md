## Final Reflection – UWP 101

Over the course of this class, I’ve grown in ways I didn’t fully expect, both as a writer and as a person. My final project, a documentary titled *Love, Your Son*, was more than just an academic assignment; it was an intimate letter to my late father, a meditation on masculinity, identity, and grief. Creating this piece pushed me to blend visual storytelling with written narrative in a way that was emotionally honest and structurally sound. Through multiple drafts, peer reviews, and reflections, I developed a deeper understanding of how to write with purpose, precision, and vulnerability. I also learned about the processes that work for me when it comes to being creative in my writing, and the processes that don't work for me either. Essentially, I've come to know myself better because of this project.

This class taught me how to take complex personal experiences and shape them into compelling, and clear communication. I learned how to revise not just for grammar or style, but for impact considering tone, audience, pacing. I also grew more comfortable with using multimodal forms of writing, integrating sound, imagery, and voiceover in ways that complemented the written script rather than competing with it. I have written scripts before, and had composed short-films, but nothing close the scope of this project. In terms of organizational structure and overall time that I put into it.

What I’ve taken from this course won’t just stay in the classroom. Whether I’m writing a personal essay, a grant proposal, a technical report, or a short film script, I’ll carry these tools with me: the ability to edit with intention, to tell a story that matters, and to write in a way that feels true. This project reminded me that writing isn’t just about being understood, it’s also about understanding myself at a deeper level.

If I were to grade myself using the rubric, I believe I’ve earned an A-. I met the requirements, engaged deeply with the material, revised thoughtfully, and produced a final project that I’m proud of—not just for its quality, but for its heart. I just struggled with getting assignments in on time (Sorry Professor Faye!)

## Flowchart

This flowchart captures the full journey of creating my final documentary project, "Love, Your Son." The process began at my main workstation (top left), where most of the scripting, editing, and online research took place. My setup includes dual monitors and a focused work environment, representing the digital heart of my creative and academic efforts.

From there, the process moved to analog thinking, my notebook (top right). Here I sketched outlines, wrote emotional reflections, and noted audience considerations. Researching my intended audience, family members, central Asian men, and those grieving, made me reconsider the tone of the project. Originally more analytical, the piece shifted toward a deeply personal narrative. This pivot made the project more vulnerable and meaningful.

The next step was grounded in tools I trust: the pencil (bottom left). This stage symbolizes hands-on scripting and revisions, where I diagrammed emotional arcs and rewrote narration to match visual cuts. It also reflects the genre research stage. Initially, I intended to create a more traditional documentary, but after viewing video essays by creators like Johnny Harris and Hassan Minhaj, I leaned into hybrid storytelling: memoir, visual essay, and cultural commentary.

Finally, the bottom right image, a selfie at my desk, represents a full-circle moment. Despite tech hiccups, audio issues, and doubts about whether I could finish it in time, I created something I’m proud of. That image captures me mid-process: editing, reflecting, and grounding myself in why I started.

This entire 'flow', from drafting and reflection to reimagining both audience and genre, shaped a project that wasn’t just about grief, but also about growth. Each arrow in the chart shows not just direction, but transformation.
