## Genre Analysis

For my project, I’m working within the genre of the *Personal Narrative Video Documentary*—a hybrid form of digital storytelling that blends reflective narration, aesthetic cinematography, and intimate glimpses into the creator’s personal life. This genre thrives on platforms like YouTube and Vimeo, where creators bypass traditional filmmaking structures to tell stories rooted in memory, identity, and lived experience. It's often used by indie filmmakers, students, and content creators who want to capture meaningful transitions or moments in their lives with authenticity and emotional depth.

The key traits of this genre include emotionally resonant visuals, introspective voiceovers, and a strong sense of openness between creator and viewer. Strong writing plays a central role—often through voice narration or on-screen text—to express what isn’t always spoken out loud. In *The Vietnam Notebook* by Casey Neistat (2019), handheld footage, real phone calls, and quiet monologues created a raw, unfiltered tone that made the viewer feel immersed in a personal memory. In *How a Filmmaker Sees the World* by Elliot Lim (2023), the narration was poetic and the visuals were more polished, but both maintained a sincere, reflective quality. These examples revealed how writing and visuals work together to express emotion through tone, pacing, and language.

Despite differences in style and production, both videos illustrate that this genre is flexible and open to innovation. What matters most isn’t equipment or budget—it’s the emotional connection. That connection is built through a blend of real footage, symbolic imagery, and genuine voiceover. Traditional plot structures are often set aside in favor of thematic or emotional progression, letting the narrator’s feelings guide the arc. For my own project, I’ll center the story around memory, using visuals and narration to reflect on how my family has shaped me. I want the film to feel immersive and real, but also purposeful and poetic in tone.

This genre succeeds when the story feels honest and intentional. Viewers respond when the creator is willing to be vulnerable, and when visuals and narration work in harmony. My goal is to achieve that same depth—blending the techniques I’ve studied with my own voice and vision. By doing so, I hope to create a piece that resonates personally and artistically.

## Audience Analysis

My project is a short-form documentary that tells a personal story about how family, immigration, and generational struggle have shaped my relationship with education. It centers on my family’s journey and how their sacrifices and cultural values influenced my path as a first-generation college student. The film highlights the pressure, resilience, and emotional weight many students like me carry—blending personal storytelling with broader themes that affect a specific community.

The primary audience is first-generation college students from immigrant families, typically ages 16 to 26. Many are in college or high school, trying to balance academic goals with family obligations. While they may not always articulate what they’re going through, they’ll recognize their experiences in this story. This audience is diverse, culturally grounded, and highly familiar with digital media. The documentary will be shared on YouTube, where this audience already engages with similar content, and also on a personal blog-style website that provides additional context.

The purpose of this documentary is to make people in this community feel seen. I want to affirm their experiences and give them language to talk about what they’ve lived through. The project is reflective and emotional, designed to break the sense of isolation many first-gen students feel, and to help build a sense of community. Honest, grounded storytelling can offer validation and solidarity where there’s often silence.

Given the audience’s media habits and preferences, I’ll use clear, natural language—no overly academic or formal tone. I’ll include visuals like old family photos, voiceover narration, and subtitled interviews to keep things accessible and personal. The pacing will be intentional, holding space for emotion without dragging.

I want to come across as grounded, vulnerable, and real—like someone telling their story, not lecturing. A personal documentary is the best genre for this purpose. It allows for a mix of emotion, storytelling, and reflection in a way that feels intimate. By publishing on YouTube and linking it to a companion blog, I can make it easy for the audience to find, watch, and connect with the story on their own terms.
