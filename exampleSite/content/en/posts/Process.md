## Project Planning & Development

This page highlights the journey behind my documentary project, *Love, Your Son*. It documents my brainstorming, planning, emotional development, and feedback processes that shaped the final piece.

Due to formatting limitations with embedded images and documents, Iâ€™ve provided Google Doc links for clarity and accessibility.
