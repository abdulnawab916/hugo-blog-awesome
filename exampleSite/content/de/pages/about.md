This site is a space where I share the things I build, think about, and care for.

My name is Abdul Hanan Nawab. I’m a Computer Science (College of Engineering) graduate from UC Davis. I am a documentarian by instinct.

This site is for sharing:
- Coding projects I’ve built or contributed to  
- Essays and reflections on life 
- Visual work from my documentary and photography  
- Thoughts on real-world events occuring, and side-interests / hobbie projects

To whoever reads through my site, I hope that you can take something away from it.

— Love,  
Abdul
